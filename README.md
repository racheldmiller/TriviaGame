# TriviaGame
A trivia game that has timer functionality. Built using Javascript and jQuery.

Small victories:
Was able to get the start button to hide and display the question & answer options. (I have a nice background image of Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta... it doesn't look like it's appearing when I go to my github.io. However, you can see the image in my image folder).

Struggles: 
My original for loop (which should've looped through the different questionas and answers I created) did not work. It would not print any questions or answers onto the screen. What I found, however, is if I isolated an individual element, it worked. For presentation purposes, I left it as that. 

I worked with my tutor, who told me I should consider a for each loop. I looked at a lot of resources online, and I cannot figure out how to create a for each loop. 

My timer does not work at all. I worked with Randall on Friday afternoon to talk through our codes. She tried to help me with my timer, but we couldn't figure out why it's not working. We thought maybe it's hidden, but even after switching it to .show(), it's still not working. 

I will definitely be throwing this into the backlog of assignments I need regraded :'(
